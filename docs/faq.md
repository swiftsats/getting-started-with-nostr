# Nostr FAQ ❓

Answers to common beginner questions about Nostr:

---

### 💰 Do I need Bitcoin or Lightning to use Nostr?

No. You can join, post, follow, and interact on Nostr without ever using Bitcoin.  
Lightning is only needed if you want to send or receive **zaps** (tips).

---

### 🔐 What happens if I lose my `nsec`?

Unfortunately, you lose access to your Nostr identity — forever.  
There’s no recovery system, so **back it up** securely.

---

### 📱 Can I use multiple apps or clients?

Yes! Your identity (keys) work across all clients.  
You can switch anytime, and your followers/posts come with you.

---

### 🐦 Is Nostr just “decentralized Twitter”?

Nostr supports Twitter-like apps (like Damus or Snort),  
but it’s a protocol — it can also power chats, blogs, marketplaces, and more.
