# Getting Started with Nostr 🚀

Welcome! Nostr is not an app — it's a **protocol**. That means you can use different apps (called clients) to access the same network.

### 🔑 No sign-ups, no passwords
You generate a cryptographic key — this becomes your identity.

- `nsec`: Your private key — **do not share**
- `npub`: Your public identity — safe to share

### ✅ What you’ll need:
- A Nostr-compatible client (see [Clients](clients.md))
- A way to save your `nsec` safely (password manager, paper, etc.)
- Optional: a Lightning wallet to send/receive zaps

### 📦 Next steps:
- Try a beginner-friendly client like [iris.to](https://iris.to) or [snort.social](https://snort.social)
- Save your keys!
- Make your first post (“note”)
